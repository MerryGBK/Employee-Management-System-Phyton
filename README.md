# Employee Management System

The Employee Management System is a Python-based application designed to manage
employee records in a simple and structured manner. The system allows users to
add, update, search, and remove employee information through a menu-driven
console interface.

This project demonstrates practical programming skills, structured logic,
and basic system design concepts applicable to real-world HR and administrative
systems.

## Technologies
- Python

---

## System Overview
The system stores employee information using structured data and provides
functions to manage employee records efficiently. It focuses on clarity,
data consistency, and ease of use, making it suitable as a foundational
employee management solution.

---

## Features
- Add new employee records (e.g. ID, name, role, department)
- Update existing employee information
- Search employees by ID or name
- Remove employee records
- Display all employees in a clear and formatted output
- Menu-driven console interface

---

## Data Handling
Employee data is managed using Python data structures such as dictionaries
and lists. This approach allows efficient data manipulation while keeping
the system lightweight and easy to understand.

Input validation is implemented to ensure correct data entry and prevent
invalid or unexpected input.

---

## Security Considerations
- Input validation to reduce incorrect data entry
- Controlled access to employee operations through structured program flow
- Emphasis on data integrity and consistent record management

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python fundamentals
- Functions and modular programming
- Data structures (lists and dictionaries)
- Control flow (loops and conditional logic)
- Basic error handling and input validation
- Clean and readable code structure

---

## How to Run
1. Open a terminal in the project directory
2. Run the application using:
   ```bash
   python employee_management.py
